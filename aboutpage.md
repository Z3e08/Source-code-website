<h1> So what is streetwear?</h1>
<p> Streetwear is a type of clothing designed for teenagers, young adults, and skateboarders. With the main objective being to keep fashion to a "street-friendly look". Streetwear also comes in various different forms, such as individual pieces of clothing and sneakers. Streetwear has also given birth to a sub-genre of clothing and fashion enthusiasts called "hypebeasts". A hypebeast is someone who spends large sums of money to buy whatever clothes or shoes that are popular at that given time. As a result of this, they end up creating huge collections of clothes and some even create businesses where they re-sell their un-used items. Naturally, over the years, streetwear has exploded in popularity, making the most simple piece of clothing cost hundreds of pounds, if not thousands. Certain tee shirts with graphics on them can sell for upwards of Â£2000 depending on the brand, colours, and type of branding on that specific piece of clothing. This mainly stems from extremely high demand and low supply. Therefore, the aftermarket for these items can be extremely expensive for the average consumer. As a result of this, streetwear has grown into a bit of a heated fight between resellers (people who only buy streetwear to sell it and make a profit) and the people who buy these clothes for their own personal use. To see who can buy these items when they go on sale for the right price, General clothing brands such as Nike, Adidas, and Puma haven't matched these "designer" brands such as Supreme, Bape, Off-White, and Palace in terms of product pricing, but they have tried to implement streetwear into their catalogues to further grow their consumer numbers. Thus, making streetwear an essential genre of clothing for today's fashion industry.</p>
